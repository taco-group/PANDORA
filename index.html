        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>We present PANDORA, a novel diffusion-based
          policy learning framework designed specifically for dexterous
          robotic piano performance. Our approach employs a condi-
          tional U-Net architecture enhanced with FiLM-based global
          conditioning, which iteratively denoises noisy action sequences
          into smooth, high-dimensional trajectories. To achieve precise
          key execution coupled with expressive musical performance, we
          design a composite reward function that integrates task-specific
          accuracy, audio fidelity, and high-level semantic feedback from
          a large language model (LLM) oracle. The LLM oracle as-
          sesses musical expressiveness and stylistic nuances, enabling dy-
          namic, hand-specific reward adjustments. Further augmented
          by a residual inverse-kinematics refinement policy, PANDORA
          achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ROBOPIANIST
          environment, significantly outperforming baselines in both pre-
          cision and expressiveness. Ablation studies validate the critical
          contributions of diffusion-based denoising and LLM-driven
          semantic feedback in enhancing robotic musicianship</p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <img src="Pipeline_PANDORA.jpg" alt="PANDORA Pipeline" class="image">
        <p>The pipeline begins with the robot state <code>s_t</code> and goal state <code>g_t</code> that condition a U-Net (via FiLM)
          to iteratively denoise an initial noisy action <code>x_t</code> into <code>x_0</code> using DDIM.
          The denoised action <code>x_0</code> is then added to the IK solverâ€™s output <code>q</code>
          (residual combination) to form the final action, which is executed in MuJoCo.
          An Oracle Reward module, driven by a large language model, evaluates the performance
          based on style and accuracy.
