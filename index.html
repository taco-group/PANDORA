      <p>
          The pipeline begins with the robot state \(s_t\) and goal state \(g_t\) that condition a U-Net (via FiLM)
          to iteratively denoise an initial noisy action \(x_t\) into \(x_0\) using DDIM.
          The denoised action \(x_0\) is then added to the IK solverâ€™s output \(q\)
          (residual combination) to form the final action, which is executed in MuJoCo.
          An Oracle Reward module, driven by a large language model, evaluates the performance
          based on style and accuracy.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>We present PANDORA, a novel diffusion-based policy learning framework designed specifically for dexterous
          robotic piano performance. Our approach employs a conditional U-Net architecture enhanced with FiLM-based global
          conditioning, which iteratively denoises noisy action sequences into smooth, high-dimensional trajectories. 
          To achieve precise key execution coupled with expressive musical performance, we design a composite reward 
          function that integrates task-specific accuracy, audio fidelity, and high-level semantic feedback from a large 
          language model (LLM) oracle. The LLM oracle assesses musical expressiveness and stylistic nuances, enabling 
          dynamic, hand-specific reward adjustments. Further augmented by a residual inverse-kinematics refinement 
          policy, PANDORA achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ROBOPIANIST environment, significantly 
          outperforming baselines in both precision and expressiveness. Ablation studies validate the critical 
          contributions of diffusion-based denoising and LLM-driven semantic feedback in enhancing robotic musicianship.</p>
